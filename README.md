# Welcome

Greetings, esteemed readers, and a warm welcome to my blog. My name is Alba Cruz Rodríguez and this is my website for the mobile robotics subject. These space will be dedicated to my practices, their development, the differents ideas and these results until we find the solution.

Robotics is a discipline we seek to solve some problems to the humanity joining sensors, actuators and software on a machine. In this doctrine studies the systems that make a connection intelligent between the perceptual and acting system. We will focus on the "brain" of the machine (or the *software*), devising the most effective and efficient algorithm for each project.

Join me to discover the exciting world of robotics and the discipline of *Mobile Robotics*!
